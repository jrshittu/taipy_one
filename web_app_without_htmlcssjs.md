## Building Web Apps with Taipy <a name="build"></a>
**Requirement:** Python 3.8 or later on Linux, Windows, and Mac. 

**Installing Taipy:** Open up a terminal and run the following command, which will install Taipy with all its dependencies.

```bash
pip install taipy
```
Hence, let say hello to Taipy...

![hi_py](https://github.com/jrshittu/build_with_taipy/assets/110542235/3667c954-c4e6-4224-b76c-0cb59bb00450)

```python
# import the library
from taipy import Gui

page = "# Hello Taipy!" 

# run the gui
Gui(page).run()
```

Save the code as a Python file: e.g., `app.py`. 
Run the code and wait for the client link `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to display and pop up in your browser. 

You can change the port if you want to run multiple servers at the same time with `Gui(...).run(port=xxxx)`.

### Project One: Personal Details Generator
![fake](https://github.com/jrshittu/taipy_one/assets/110542235/9c4e6803-eec4-4a4d-86ab-45ef98d3b357)

A simple GUI application that generates random user details, including a name, phone number, and address, using the `Faker` library.

**Full code**
```python
from faker import Faker
from taipy.gui import Gui, notify

name = ""
phone = ""
address = ""

fake = Faker()

def generate_name(state):
    state.name = fake.name()
    state.phone = fake.phone_number()
    state.address = fake.address()
    notify(state, 'info', f'Here is your new details: {state.name}')

page = """
# Generate Fake Data {: .color-primary}

<|personal.png|image|> <br />
Generated name is: <|{name}|> <br />
Generated Phone Number: <|{phone}|> <br />
Generated Address: <|{address}|>

<|Generate|button|class_name=plain mt1 p1|on_action=generate_name|>
"""

Gui(page).run(debug=True, title="Fake Details")
```
**Q:** What do you think will happen when you run the program?

Now, let's break it down and create the program step by step

**Step 1: Import the required libraries**

* Import the `Faker` library to generate fake data.
* Import the `Gui` and `notify` classes from `taipy.gui` to create the GUI and display notifications.
```python
from faker import Faker
from taipy.gui import Gui, notify
```
**Step 2: Initialize global variables**

Initialize three global variables `name`, `phone`, and `address` as empty strings. These variables will store the generated fake data.
```python
name = ""
phone = ""
address = ""
```
**Step 3: Create an instance of the `Faker` class**

Create an instance of the `Faker` class to generate fake data.
```python
fake = Faker()
```
**Step 4: Define the `generate_name` function**

Define a function `generate_detail` that takes a `state` parameter. This function generates fake data using the `Faker` instance and updates the global variables `name`, `phone`, and `address` with the generated data. The `notify` function is used to display a notification to the user with the generated name.
```python
def generate_detail(state):
    state.name = fake.name()
    state.phone = fake.phone_number()
    state.address = fake.address()
    notify(state, 'info', f'Here is your new details: {state.name}')
```
**Step 5: Define the Taipy GUI page layout**

Define the Taipy GUI page layout using Markdown syntax. The layout includes a header, an image, three text fields to display the generated fake data, and a button to generate new data. The `on_action` attribute of the button is set to the `generate_name` function.
```python
page = """
# Generate Fake Data {: .color-primary}

<|personal.png|image|> <br />
Generated name is: <|{name}|> <br />
Generated Phone Number: <|{phone}|> <br />
Generated Address: <|{address}|>

<|Generate|button|class_name=plain mt1 p1|on_action=generate_detail|>
"""
```
**Step 6: Run the Taipy GUI application**

Finally, run the Taipy GUI application using the `Gui` class. The `page` variable is passed to the `Gui` constructor to set the page layout. The `debug` parameter is set to `True` to enable debug mode, and the `title` parameter is set to `"Fake Details"` to set the application title.
```python
Gui(page).run(debug=True, title="Fake Details")
```

When you run this code, the "Generate" button triggers the `generate_detail` function, which updates the displayed data and shows a notification with the generated name.

### Project 2: Image Background Remover ðŸ¤–
![bg_remover](https://github.com/jrshittu/build_with_taipy/assets/110542235/9c9d321c-90ca-4faf-876d-c8ae7a88c0fd)

Now let's create a Taipy GUI app to remove backgrounds from images

**Full Code: `main.py`**
```python
from PIL import Image
from rembg import remove
from taipy.gui import Gui, notify
from io import BytesIO

image_upload = ""
image_download = "removebg_img.png"
old_image = None
new_image = None
bg_removed = False

def convert_image(img):
    buf = BytesIO()
    img.save(buf, format="PNG")
    byte_im = buf.getvalue()
    return byte_im

def rm_bg(state):
    notify(state, 'info', 'Uploading image...')
    image = Image.open(state.image_upload)
    
    notify(state, 'info', 'Removing bg...')
    new_image = remove(image)
    new_image.save("removebg_img.png")

    notify(state, 'success', 'bg removed successfully!')
    state.old_image = convert_image(image)
    state.new_image = convert_image(new_image)
    state.bg_removed = True

page = """
# Image Background Remover {: .color-primary}
Upload an Image: <|{image_upload}|file_selector|extensions=.png,.jpg|on_action=rm_bg|> <br />
<|{old_image}|image|>
<|{new_image}|image|><br/>
<|{image_download}|file_download|label=Download Image|active={bg_removed}|>
"""

Gui(page).run(debug=True)
```

Now, let's break it down and create the program step by step

**Step 1: Import necessary libraries**

In this step, we import the necessary libraries for working with images, removing backgrounds, creating a GUI, and working with binary data.
```python
from PIL import Image
from rembg import remove
from taipy.gui import Gui, notify
from io import BytesIO
```
**Step 2: Initialize variables**

In this step, we initialize variables for storing the uploaded image file, the name of the downloaded image file, the original and processed images, and a boolean variable for indicating whether the background has been removed.
```python
image_upload = ""
image_download = "removebg_img.png"
old_image = None
new_image = None
bg_removed = False
```
**Step 3: Define the `convert_image` function**

In this step, we define a function for converting an image to binary data. This function takes an image as input and returns its binary data.
```python
def convert_image(img):
    buf = BytesIO()
    img.save(buf, format="PNG")
    byte_im = buf.getvalue()
    return byte_im
```
**Step 4: Define the `rm_bg` function**

In this step, we define a function for removing the background from an image and displaying notifications to the user. This function takes a state object as input and performs the following operations:

* Displays a notification indicating that the image is being uploaded.
* Opens the uploaded image using the `Image.open` method from the `PIL` library.
* Displays a notification indicating that the background is being removed.
* Removes the background from the image using the `remove` function from the `rembg` library.
* Saves the processed image to a file using the `save` method from the `PIL` library.
* Displays a notification indicating that the background has been removed successfully.
* Converts the original and processed images to binary data using the `convert_image` function.
* Sets the `old_image`, `new_image`, and `bg_removed` attributes of the state object to the original image data, processed image data, and `True` respectively.
```python
def rm_bg(state):
    notify(state, 'info', 'Uploading image...')
    image = Image.open(state.image_upload)

    notify(state, 'info', 'Removing bg...')
    new_image = remove(image)
    new_image.save("removebg_img.png")

    notify(state, 'success', 'bg removed successfully!')
    state.old_image = convert_image(image)
    state.new_image = convert_image(new_image)
    state.bg_removed = True
```
**Step 5: Define the GUI layout**

In this step, we define the layout of the GUI using a string. The layout consists of a file upload widget, two image display widgets, and a file download widget.
```python
page = """
# Image Background Remover {: .color-primary}
Upload an Image: <|{image_upload}|file_selector|extensions=.png,.jpg|on_action=rm_bg|> <br />
<|{old_image}|image|>
<|{new_image}|image|><br/>
<|{image_download}|file_download|label=Download Image|active={bg_removed}|>
"""
```
**Step 6: Run the GUI**

In this step, we create a `Gui` object using the `page` string and run it in debug mode.
```python
Gui(page).run(debug=True)
```
